### I quit!
After only 6 months - I quit my job at [Thoughtworks](https://www.thoughtworks.com/). I loved every single minute of it and I had the opportunity to work with some amazing people, but in the end it was just too much travel with a wife and a baby at home. 

During those 6 months I spent 71 nights in a hotel away from my wife and daughter. That's actually not too bad considering we assumed I would be on the road at least 4 days every week. I lucked out with the client I was working on - they allowed my team to work remotely every second week after the first few months.
 
 
### The experiment
Acquaintances said "That's going to be tough". Friends said "Oh shit - really?"

Everyone we talked to about accepting a job that required me to be on the road 4-5 days a week thought it was crazy - especially with a 7 month old daughter at home. Erica and I talked about it a lot. We both knew I was asking her to make a huge sacrifice so that I could pursue this amazing opportunity. 

In the end, Erica agreed to let me accept the job, with a few conditions. 

First, no more side projects. I have a tendency to get totally wrapped up in stupid little projects that don't ever go anywhere. I will spend every free moment of every evening and weekend working on it until it's either finished or I get bored of it and move on to the next project. It's not that I wasn't allowed to have side projects - just not on the weekends when I was at home with my family. That time was for family - not work and/or programming.

Second, she wanted to benefit too! If I was going to be travelling every week, then she wanted to be able to visit me in whatever city I was working in and do some travelling too. 

Third, this was never going to be a career for the rest of my life. We agreed that as Madeline got older I would need and want to be around more often. We agreed that this job had a potential lifespan of 3-5 years. Most importantly, we agreed that we would give it an honest effort for 6 months. We both knew I was asking a lot of Erica, being at home alone with a 7 month old baby while her husband lives off expenses in a swanky hotel. After 6 months, Erica was allowed to veto the TW job and ask me to look for work in Regina again. 

### The sweet new job
In the end, she agreed, and I accepted the job. The first few weeks were like living in a dream. I was exhausted from the 6am Monday morning flights and the 10 hour work days. When I got home on the weekends I did my best to live up to our agreement and not touch my laptop. 

I worked with some really smart and talented people and I learned a ton. The QA person on my team was a former Google employee who actively reviewed code and requested additional unit/integration tests or supplemented the tests themselves. Maybe I was living under a rock before - but I have never met a QA person with that kind of technical know-how! The iteration manager had a M.Sc. in Computer Science and was the least technical person on the team! I was in heaven! 
 
I could (and probably should) write several posts about being a frequent flyer - hotel and airline loyalty programs, dining out, working out, etc... For now, I will just say I racked up a ton of Aeroplan and SPG points - our next family vacation is going to be free. 

As much as I loved my job a Thoughtworks, Erica was having a rough time at home alone with Madeline, especially after her maternity leave was finished and she went back to work. I was struggling too - I was constantly tired from the travel and long work days, my social life was suffering because I wanted to spend time with Erica and Madeline whenever I was home so I didn't really see any of my friends, and I wasn't getting as much work done on side projects as I would have liked. It also goes without saying that I missed Erica and Maddie like crazy every day I was away.
 
### What next?

Next week I'll be starting a new job at [Vivvo](http://www.vivvo.com/#/home). To be honest, I'm not totally sure what I'll be doing there! From what I know, I will be working on their core product, Citizen One. Other than that - I guess I will wait to see the product backlog on Monday!
