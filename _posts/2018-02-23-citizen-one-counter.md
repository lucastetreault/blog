### Citizen One Identity Counter

![](https://github.com/lucastetreault/blog/raw/master/public/assets/c1-counter.jpg "")

At [Vivvo](http://www.vivvo.com/) we have set a goal this calendar year to hit 500k active users in the system. We are building features like crazy and we are preparing to take the product on the road to demo it across the country. I am seriously pumped about the direction the platform is taking and I think we are narrowing in on an untapped market niche that will make our platform very successful! 

When we talked about setting a goal around active users we all agreed it would be important to actively track and adjust accordingly. Of course we could have had montly reports sent out to the C-level team informing them of active users, ingress, egress, etc... But that's boring and we are a startup! 

Inspired by a [project on Sparkfun](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/large-digit-driver-hookup-guide?_ga=2.210604374.299866538.1519450863-1940185995.1519450863) we ordered the parts we needed to build our real-time counter a few months ago.

We assembled the parts today (I totally messed up one of the 7-segment LED units by ignoring the instructions when soldering the Large Digit Driver....) Tony Arkles did most of the soldering and I hacked together some Arduino C to poll our platform for the number of units and translate it to something the digits can understand. I'll have a look at our repo soon and see if that's something I can share!
