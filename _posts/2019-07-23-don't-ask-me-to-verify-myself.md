This happens to me all the time... My bank, telco, etc. will call me and ask me to answer security questions before they will discuss whatever it is they are calling about with me.

### You're training your users to ignore security
You're training your users to give away their answers to their security questions to any scammer who sounds remotely legitimate. 

### It happened again today
A Telus agent called me today and insisted I answer their security questions before they would tell me why they were calling. I asked, "How do I know you actually work for Telus?" to which they responded, "I guarantee I work for Telus." so of course I said "I guarantee I am Lucas."

### Seriously... 
If someone calls you and asks you to answer security questions, get their employee id or extension, look up the toll-free number for their company and call them back. Never answer security questions from an unsolicited phone call!
